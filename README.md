# TableTrip

## Goal

Dash server specifically for solving the editable table front-end problem for GIMS systems and GRaSP and stuff.

1) Annotate your data model - models you annotate define the tables and how they can be edited.
2) Subclass the abstract mix-ins and, optionally, implement the necesary CRUD operations (this links editing the table to persisting your data)
3) Start the server, now you can view your tables

Authentication?
CSS? JS? Coming in from dash

Do we invert control? How do end users add other dash components?



TableTrip is a simple framework for hosting a web-based interface for viewing and editing records according to an ORM-like data model you define.
